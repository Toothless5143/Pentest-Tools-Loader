These scripts are useful after installing a fresh box, if you're in a rush these scripts can help you to load all the tools you need. Use the scripts at your own risk, `vm_loader.sh` is a bash script to completely set up a kali linux installation. That script isn't done yet, I'll start working on that script soon enough. And other 2 scripts are the same just in different languages, one is in python another one is in bash. The scripts are based on linux file system, you need to configure the scripts a bit if you want to use these scripts into a windows machine.

*N.B: Don't use these tools in a real-life assessment as most of the tools are compiled they might contain malicious code that can cause harm to the customer's work environment. It's always encouraged to compile tools on your own machine before loading the tools into the customer's network/machines.*
