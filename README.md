# Pentest Tools Loader

This repository provides scripts that can be used to quickly set up a collection of pentesting tools on a fresh box. However, it is important to note that these scripts come with a disclaimer: **Use the scripts at your own risk**. 

The `vm_loader.sh` script, which is a bash script, is designed to completely set up a Kali Linux installation. Please be aware that this script is still in development and may not be fully functional at the moment. 

There are also two other scripts, one written in Python (`tools_loader.py`) and the other in bash (`tools_loader.sh`). These scripts serve a similar purpose of automating the installation process for various pentesting tools. However, it is crucial to understand that these tools are primarily intended for educational and testing purposes.

It is important to exercise caution when using these scripts, as some of the tools included may contain compiled binaries that could potentially have malicious code. Therefore, it is highly recommended to compile the tools on your own machine before deploying them in any real-life assessment or customer environment.

## Installation

To install the Pentest Tools Loader repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Toothless5143/Pentest-Tools-Loader.git
   cd Pentest-Tools-Loader
   ```

## Usage

### Python script

To run the Python script (`tools_loader.py`), execute the following command with root privileges:

```shell
sudo python3 tools_loader.py
```

### Bash script

To run the Bash script (`tools_loader.sh`), make it executable and then execute it with root privileges:

Please note that these scripts are based on the Linux file system. If you intend to use them on a Windows machine, you will need to configure the scripts accordingly.

**Important:** Once again, it is essential to exercise caution and understand the potential risks associated with using these tools. It is always recommended to use your own compiled versions of the tools and ensure that you have proper authorization before deploying any tools in a real-life assessment or customer environment.
