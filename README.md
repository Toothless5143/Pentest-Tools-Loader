These scripts are useful after installing a fresh box, if you're in a rush these scripts can help you to load all the tools you need. Use the scripts at your own risk, `vm_loader.sh` is a bash script to completely set up a kali linux installation. That script isn't done yet, I'll start working on that script soon enough.

**N.B: Don't use these tools in a real-life assessment as most of the tools are compiled they might contain malicious code that might harm the customer's environment. It's always great to compile the tools on your own machine before loading the tools into the customer's network/machines**
